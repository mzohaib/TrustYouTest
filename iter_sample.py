"""
Programming task
================

Implement the method iter_sample below to make the Unit test pass. iter_sample
is supposed to peek at the first n elements of an iterator, and determine the
minimum and maximum values (using their comparison operators) found in that
sample. To make it more interesting, the method is supposed to return an
iterator which will return the same exact elements that the original one would
have yielded, i.e. the first n elements can't be missing.

You may make use of Python's standard library. Python 3 is allowed, even though
it's not supported by codepad apparently.

Create your solution as a private fork, and send us the URL.
